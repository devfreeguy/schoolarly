##### This is a landing page for a learning plartform built with
    > HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

## Version 1
    - Made the whole site
    > Problem
        - Used an older version of `SwiperJs` (Version 10) so this caused the distortion of the site in mobile devices

## Version 1.1
    - Fixed issue with `SwiperJs` by upgrading to Version 11 and adjusting the Structure and Styling to perfection
